# Arcane Assault

Arcane Assault is a competitive first-person shooter built in Unity that replaces traditional weapons with powerful magic and runes. Players engage in fast-paced combat, using spells and magical abilities to defeat their opponents.

## Current Status

This project is a work in progress, and additional features and improvements will be made going forward.

## Current Key Features

- **Synchronized Movement**: Smooth, accurate movement using client-side prediction and reconciliation to ensure minimal lag and desync.
- **Magic Projectiles**: Fire spells with lag compensation for consistent hit detection.

## Networking

Arcane Assault uses the [Fish-Networking](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs) framework to handle its multiplayer features.
